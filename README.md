# sql_games

Games implemented as stored procedures for MariaDB. You can play them from the command-line client. Can be ran on Percona Server or Oracle MySQL, but will require some small changes because I've used some MariaDB-specific features.

Each game is in a separate directory. See the README.md in each directory for a quick explanation of the game and how to play.
